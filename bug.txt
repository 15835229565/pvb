Description
Summary: ... checking filelist pvbrowser-devel: "/opt/pvb/LICENSE.GPL" is not allowed anymore in FHS 2.2. 
  
Description:   [reply] 
Our RPM is build correctly.
But on openSUSE 11.1 (not on other distries)
there is a "... checking filelist" which fails.

We want to install to /opt/pvb
where "pvb" is the provider NOT the package and is allowed up to FHS

http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html#OPTADDONAPPLICATIONSOFTWAREPACKAGES
##############################################
/opt : Add-on application software packages
Purpose
/opt is reserved for the installation of add-on application software packages.
A package to be installed in /opt must locate its static files in a separate
/opt/<package> or /opt/<provider> directory tree, where <package> is a name
that describes the software package and <provider> is the provider's LANANA
registered name.
##############################################

I complained to "darix" on the opensuse-buildservice IRC
about 3 months ago.
He saild, that this issue could not be solved quickly because of heavy
workload.

But now it is getting urgent !!! because openSUSE 11.1 is out

Please simply remove the "... checking filelist" if you can't solve the problem
otherwise.

                      Description
                      Summary: "%if 0%{?mandriva_version}" seems not to be set on Mandriva_2009 
                        
                        Description:   [reply] 
                        I tested with the following within the spec file:

                        %if 0%{?mandriva_version}
                        echo "mandriva_version"
                        %endif


                        On Mandriva_2008 i get the echo
                        but not on Mandriva_2009
